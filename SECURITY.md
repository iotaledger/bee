# Responsible disclosure policy

At the IOTA Foundation, we consider the security of our systems a top priority.
But no matter how much effort we put into system security, there can still be
vulnerabilities present. If you've discovered a vulnerability, please follow
the guidelines below to report it to our security team:

        + E-mail your findings to [`secops@iota.org`](mailto:secops@iota.org).
          If the report contains highly sensitive information, please consider
          encrypting your findings using our `contact@iota.org`
          (466385BD0B40D9550F93C04746A440CCE5664A64) PGP key.

Please follow these rules when testing/reporting vulnerabilities:

+ Do not take advantage of the vulnerability you have discovered, for example
  by downloading more data than is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability.
+ Do not read, modify or delete data that isn't your own.
+ We ask that you do not disclose the problem to third parties until it has
  been resolved.
+ The scope of the program is limited to technical vulnerabilities in IOTA
  Foundations's web applications and open source software packages distributed
  through GitHub, please do not try to test physical security or attempt
  phishing attacks against our employees, and so on.
+ Out of concern for the availability of our services to all users, please do
  not attempt to carry out DoS attacks, leverage black hat SEO techniques, spam
  people or any other mischief (follow the golden rule). We also discourage the
  use of any vulnerability testing tools that automatically generate
  significant volumes of traffic.

What we promise:

+ We will respond to your report within 3 business days with our evaluation of
  the report and an expected resolution date.
+ If you have followed the instructions above, we will not take any legal
  action against you in regard to the report.
+ We will keep you informed during all stages of resolving the problem.
+ To show our appreciation for your effort and cooperation during the report,
  we will list your name and a link to a personal website/social network
  profile on the page below so that the public can know you've helped keep the
  IOTA Foundation secure.

We sincerely appreciate the efforts of security researchers in keeping our
community safe.
